// Inertial Bounce (moves settle into place after bouncing around a little)

// I feel like this is probably based on something from MotionScript.com, but
// this is the closest one I see online:

// These are the settings to tweak to customize the animation
// Amplitude controls how "stretchy" the rubber band is
// Frequency determines how fast it vibrates
// Decay is how fast it settles down. [not sure which way it goes]
